# java-todolist
Part of the University of Helsinki's exercises for learning Java programming, this exercise allows the user to create a to-do list once the program is run, to list the tasks out, and to remove the tasks once they are finished. All the commands are located in the UserInterface.java file. This exercise was helpful for practicing the "separation of concerns" idea in OOP, especially when it comes to separating the logic of the program vs. the user-interface in different classes and objects.
